# Stock Pitch AI - Free vs. Premium Modes

- **Free Mode:** Uses rule-based logic and public data. No OpenAI API key required. Generates basic but complete analysis and PowerPoint.
- **Premium (AI) Mode:** Uses OpenAI GPT-4o(-mini) for advanced, data-driven, and explainable analysis. Requires your own OpenAI API key (see `GET_API_KEY.md`).

**To use premium mode:**
1. Get your OpenAI API key (see `GET_API_KEY.md`).
2. Add it to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`.
3. Run the app and select "Premium" mode for AI-powered analysis and presentations.
